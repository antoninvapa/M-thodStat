This repository is all the exercises and my final exam of the Statistical Method course. 
It is interesting since it displays all the main statistical tools that could be used in data analysis: it's a little library.

###Final Exam One-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator
If you look closer at the final project, we had the choice between two problems, I chose the first one even though I started the second for fun. 
The project was about building an MC simulation from an energy probability density function of a One-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator. 
Then analyze the result: 
  - Basic statistical properties: probability density function demonstration, equipartition theorem, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
  - Convergences: Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem.
  - Ï‡2 distribution.
  - Parameter estimation: maximum likelihood method, least squares method, MC integral.
  - Hypothesis testing: Kolmogorov Test
  - Fisher information
